# Hi there 👋, I am Abisheak Jacob  

---

> I am an Optimization Research Analyst who specializes in designing, developing, and deploying algorithms for the airline industry.

> I’m passionate about Advanced Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation and I love to uncover the stories and patterns that the data holds. My interest in Analytics began when I was working as an Intern at Saint Gobain India. I found that I had a knack for working with numbers and deriving trends and insights from them. I therefore went into Business Analytics.

> I am proficient in working with Python, PowerBI, SQL, and Google Operational Research Tools. I am adept in Data Analytics, Market Research,  Optimization Modelling, Visualization, and Workflow Management.

> My goal is to become a top leader in the analytics domain. I’m looking for opportunities to work with Deep Learning Models and Generative AI.
